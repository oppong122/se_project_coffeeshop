1. I first of all set up the page and applied the various style with the help of the video and the brief provided by the instructors.
   I also used my knowledge from the previous coding projects.

2. i came down to the reservation section, this is where i learned how to set up forms by the use of <form></form> tag and _feildset_

3. on this stage i learned how to use the _span_ tag is setting up menu for my project.

4. This 4th part includes my contanct and footer, where i learn how to use transitions in designing my about section to catch clients eye. properties like @keyframes and animation was very helpful on this stage of my project

5. finally to the footer which was mainly show my name as an author and other contacts
